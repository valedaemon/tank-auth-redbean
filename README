OVERVIEW
Tank_Auth (http://konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/) is an authentication library for Codeigniter 
(http://www.codeigniter.com).

By default, Tank_Auth's models are written solely for use with Codeigniter's DB class. This package converts those 
models so that they utilize Redbean's methods instead.

This is an alpha package as not all functions have been unit tested. However, all basic functionality has been
confirmed through testing.

INSTALLATION
To install this, copy the three model files into your <codeigniter>/application/models/tank_auth/ directory. If you
wish to keep the original models, be sure to back them up first.
